# Pretty-Printing Combinators

A Dart port of [Christian Lindig's strict
version](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.34.2200) of
[Wadler's pretty-printing
combinators](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf).
The present version deforests away the second intermediate tree of Lindig's
implementation, which should make it slightly more efficient.

Please refer to the [tutorial](http://polux.github.io/pretty_demo/web/pretty_demo.html) and the [API docs](http://www.dartdocs.org/documentation/pretty/latest/index.html).
